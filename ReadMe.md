## 💎 Jewelry E-Commerce Website

This project is a responsive and modern jewelry e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It displays a wide range of jewelry products, including featured collections, new arrivals, discounted items, and special sales deals in an attractive and easy-to-use interface.

The website is designed with a clean layout and smooth navigation to provide an enjoyable browsing experience across all devices. Bootstrap is used to implement a mobile-first design approach and to create reusable UI components such as navigation bars, product cards, banners, and buttons. JavaScript enhances the site with interactive elements and dynamic content behavior, improving overall user engagement.

This project highlights practical frontend development skills including responsive web design, layout structuring, DOM manipulation, and integration of modern UI frameworks. It is ideal for showcasing in a developer portfolio and can be extended into a full e-commerce solution by adding features such as a shopping cart, user authentication, backend services, and secure online payment integration.

A live demo of the project is available via GitHub Pages for easy viewing and sharing.
